# Acknowledgements

Thanks to:

Ryan Dahl for building node.js, my favorite new plaything.

Micheil Smith, for the examples of cookies and sessions with node.js, and for
being patient with my mangling of his name.

Everyone else involved in the creation of node.js and the many other projects
that have sprung up around it.
