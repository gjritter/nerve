# Acknowledgements

Thanks to:

Ryan Dahl for building node.js, my favorite new plaything.

Gianni Chiappetta and Noah Sloan, for encouraging me to write good code
instead of cute code.

Micheil Smith, for the examples of cookies and sessions with node.js, and for
being patient with my mangling of his name.

Chad Etzel, for writing the example that shows off Nerve with
[template.node.js](http://github.com/jazzychad/template.node.js).

Everyone else involved in the creation of node.js and the many other projects
that have sprung up around it.
